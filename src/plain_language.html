      <p>This section refers to the audience as users since that is a more common term in the web
        community. To effectively communicate with your web users, you must use plain-language
        techniques to write web content. This section will explain the differences between print
        and web writing and how to create sites that work for your users.

    <article class="pt-4" role="article" aria-labelledby="articleHeader2">
      <h2 class="text-center" role="heading" aria-level="2" id="articleHeader2">How do people use the web?</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>People use the internet to easily find, understand, and use information to complete a task.
        Unlike print media, people do not read entire web pages. They scan instead. Nielsen and
        Morkes, in a famous 1997 study, found that 79 percent of their test users always scanned
        any new page they came across; only 16 percent read word-by-word.</p>

      <p>Even with more people using the web, the percent of content that is read on a website has
        not increased by much. Here are some facts to consider when writing web content:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>In a 2008 study, based on analysis of 45,237 page views, Nielsen found that web
          users only read about 18% of what’s one page.</li>
        <li>As the number of words on a page goes up, the percentage read goes down.</li>
        <li>To get people to read half your words, you must limit your page to 110 words or
          fewer.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 role="heading" aria-level="3">What do web users look at?</h3>
      <p>Since we know web users scan web pages, we need to learn what they look at.</p>
      <p>Users often scan pages in an F pattern focusing on the top left side of the page, headings,
        and the first few words of a sentence or bulleted list. On average, users only read the first
        two words on each line. Also, users can decide in as little as five seconds whether your site
        is useful to them.
      </p>

      <p>Here is an image of one of the eye tracking pages. The red shows where the user looked the
        most:</p>

      <hr>
      <p>Think about how well your website allows customers to get something done.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Customers come to your site to perform a task.</li>
        <li>They come because they expect to get self-service.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>People come to your website with a specific task in mind. If your website doesn’t help them
        complete that task, they’ll leave.</p>

      <p>You need to identify the mission — the purpose — of your website, to help you clarify the
        top task your website should help people accomplish.</p>

      </h2>
      <hr>
      <p>In order to write for your users, you need to know who they are! Here are some general
        tips to help you identify your users:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Listen to user questions — what do your visitors ask when they send you an email
          or call your office?</li>
        <li>Talk to users and ask them what they want.</li>
        <li>Analyze your web metrics to figure out what people are looking for on your website:
          <ul>
            <li>What are your most-visited pages and where do people spend the most time?</li>
            <li>What top search phrases do people use?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>There are many techniques to help you learn about your users. For details and best

      <h2 class="text-center" role="heading" aria-level="2" id="articleHeader5">Write web content</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>After identifying your users and their top tasks, it is time to actually write web content. If
        you think it would be easy to just duplicate information you’ve written for print
        documents, you are wrong. While the information is helpful, it’s not in the right format for
        the web. Remember, people scan web pages and only read about 18 percent of what’s on
        the page! This means you need to cut whatever you have in print form by 50 percent!</p>

      <h3 role="heading" aria-level="3">Good Web Content Uses:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The inverted pyramid style.</strong>Begin with the shortest and clearest statement you
          can make about your topic. Put the most important information at the top and the
          background at the bottom.</li>
        <li><strong>Chunked content.</strong> Don’t try to pack everything into long paragraphs. Split topics
          up into logical sections separated by informative headings.</li>
        <li><strong>Only necessary information:</strong> Use only the information your users need to achieve
          their tops tasks. Omit unnecessary information.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 role="heading" aria-level="3">Remember</h3>
      <p>Your content is <strong>NOT</strong> clear unless your users can: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find what they need</li>
        <li>understand what they find</li>
        <li>Use what they find to meet their needs</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-center" role="heading" aria-level="2" id="articleHeader6">Repurpose print material for the web
      </h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Don’t cut and paste the text of print documents to create web content. People are more
        likely to leave your webpage, potentially costing you time and money, because they will not
        take the time to find what they are looking for.</p>

      <p>Print writing is different from web writing. Print is very linear and narrative driven. In
        print, you can go into great detail about mundane things like eating breakfast. If you are a
        great writer, that can be an interesting story. But, those interesting stories don't work on
        the web. Instead they slow down web users who are trying to accomplish a task.</p>

      <p>Jakob Nielsen (useit.com) explains that “Web users want actionable content; they don’t
        want to fritter away their time on (otherwise enjoyable) stories that are tangential to their
        current goals.”</p>

      <p>Because the web is “action-oriented,” you need to repurpose your print document.</p>

      <p>Pick out necessary information in your print document that will help your web users and
        create a new web page.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Keep the most important and clear message at the top of the web page</li>
        <li>Chunk your content into logical sections</li>
        <li>Use headings to help users navigate the content</li>
        <li>Highlight key facts in a bulleted list</li>
        <li>Explain complex instructions in a visually appealing If/Then table.</li>

      <h2 class="text-center" role="heading" aria-level="2" id="articleHeader7">Avoid PDF overload</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Posting PDF versions (PDFs) of original documents on your site would seem to be an
        obvious alternative to re-writing your content in web-format. Unfortunately, this would
        work against your goal of retaining users. Posting too many PDF documents on your
        website can work against you. The Nielsen group has done multiple studies on PDFs and
        has consistently found that users hate them and try to avoid reading PDFs at all costs.</p>

      <p>PDF files:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Are slow to open and can sometimes crash a computer if they are too large</li>
        <li>Are difficult for some screen users to read</li>
        <li>Can make a user lose the website if they open in the same window</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you need to post a PDF use a gateway page — a web page that includes information
        about the PDF, including.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>What it's about</li>
        <li>How large the file is</li>
        <li>Who might find the information helpful</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Remember to follow 508-compliance guidelines when using PDFs. See
        www.section508.gov for more information on 508-compliance.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>Many government websites and letters contain meaningless formal language such as
        flowery welcome messages and “we hope you get a lot out of our program” messages.
        Using this type of language wastes space and your users’ time. It conveys the impression
        that you are insincere. Don’t waste your users’ time. Instead, get directly to the point.
        Remember, time is money on the web. Keep your important information at the top of a web
        page. Don’t bury it under fluff messages.</p>

      <p>Here is a breif list of meaningless filler phrases</p>

      <h2 class="text-center" role="heading" aria-level="2" id="articleHeader10">Write effective links</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Links are about both content and navigation. Effective link names are key to satisfying your
        customers. The Eyetracking Studies showed links written in plain-language were the most
        effective. Plain-language links are written clearly so that the user understands exactly
        where the link will take them.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Link names should be the same as the page name linked to.</li>
        <li>Don't use the full name of a document or program as a link name.</li>
        <li>Be as explicit as you can - too long is better than too short.</li>
        <li>Make the link meaningful. Don't use "click here" or "more".</li>
        <li>Don't embed links in text. It just invites people to leave your text!</li>
        <li>Add a short description when needed to clarify the link.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Remember, some of your users might be visually disabled. Do not use “Click Here” or “Click
        the green button” links. Make sure your links are accessible to all users. You want to use
        links that clearly explain the content of the page it links to. If your link says “Annual
        Reports,” then destination page must be titled “Annual Reports.”</p>
