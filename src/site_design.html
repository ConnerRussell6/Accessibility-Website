            <p>I chose this visual design to align with the WCAG 2.1 level AA guidlines. The colors create enough
                contrast to meet the requirements. I also wanted a lot of white space to make it easier to read for
                people with all kinds of different disabilities. The font was chosen to based on the WCAG guidelines.
                There was also a need to make sure that the navigation was specificly chosen to ensure that a screen
                reader would be able to navigate and the average user would know exactly what page they were on. </p>

            <h2 class="text-center" role="heading" aria-level="2" id="articleHeader2">Structural Design</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The structure of the website is in compliance with the WCAG 2.1 level AA guidelines. The whole page is
                correctly coded to include the ids, arias, and roles. This helps screenreaders navigate the site easier.
                The headings are in order from highest priority to the lowest. There is a clear consistent layout to
                each page and a logical reading order to promote perceivability and understand for user with varying
                abilities. </p>
